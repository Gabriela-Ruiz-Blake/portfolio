          Gabriela Ruiz-Blake was born in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. Growing up
          in a bicultural family with deep roots across the world, she developed
          a global view at a young age. At 14 years old she began her outreach
          work in many developing nations. Her work with underserved immigrant
          communities in the United States has allowed her to witness firsthand
          the importance of access to financial and health systems. This
          understanding was then intensified when she studied microeconomics in
          Bangladesh and learned that, with free healthcare for women, families
          can dig themselves out of the poverty trap. Her work in micro
          insurance in Puerto Rico helped her understand the importance of
          environmental protection. In 2017, she graduated from Sewanee: The
          University of the South with a degree in economics. After college she
          returned to Mallorca and has been working with the Mallorca Womenâ€™s
          March to help activate expats and help them engage with local and
          international politics.
